MANCHESTER , England 1996-08-28
Britain 's <>Chris Boardman</> fulfilled his prediction that he would break the world 4,000 metres world record in the world track cycling championships on Wednesday .
<>Boardman</> clocked four minutes 13.353 seconds to slice more than six seconds from the previous world mark of 4:19.699 set by Olympic champion <>Andrea Collinelli</> of Italy in Atlanta in July .
<>Collinelli</> qualified in second place , also beating his old record in 4:17.696 .
" I was very nervous before the start but then I was amazed by the speed of my ride , " <>Boardman</> said . "
I do n't know if I can go any faster .
Who knows what will happen in the later stages ? "
<>Boardman</> , 28 , did not contest the Olympic pursuit because of its proximity to the Tour de France in which he led the French GAN team .
However , he took a bronze medal in the Olympic road time-trial and then returned home to prepare for the world track series in the Manchester indoor velodrome .
He adopted the " superman " riding position with arms at full stretch perfected by fellow Briton <>Graeme Obree</> , the 1995 world champion , and taken up in Atlanta by <>Collinelli</> .
<>Obree</> was forced to pull out of his title defence because of a viral infection .
